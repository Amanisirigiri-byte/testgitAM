Preparing story points for testing involves estimating the **effort required to test a user story**, not just by time but also considering **complexity, risks, and uncertainty**. Here’s a clear step-by-step approach to prepare story points specifically for **testing tasks**:

### ✅ Step-by-Step: How to Estimate Story Points for Testing

#### 1. **Understand the User Story Clearly**

* Review the **Acceptance Criteria** and **Definition of Done**.
* Clarify scope with the Product Owner or BA if needed.
* Understand dependencies (e.g., environment setup, APIs, backend readiness).

#### 2. **Break Down Testing Tasks**

* Functional Testing
* UI/UX Validation
* Test Case Preparation
* Regression Impact
* Automation (if in-sprint)
* Performance/Load Testing (if applicable)
* Test Data Preparation
* Bug Rework Time

#### 3. **Consider Complexity Factors**

Ask yourself:

* Are new components involved?
* Are integrations with external systems required?
* Is the business logic complex?
* Are there any unknowns or risks?

#### 4. **Use a Standard Scale**

Most teams use **Fibonacci series**:
`1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21` – where:

* **1–3**: Simple testing, clear requirements.
* **5–8**: Medium complexity, multiple validations, or backend dependency.
* **13+**: Complex, multiple integrations, automation effort, or unclear areas.

#### 5. **Discuss in Sprint Planning / Poker Sessions**

* Use **Planning Poker** to align the QA and Dev teams.
* Justify your estimate: “This story is a 5 for QA because we need test data setup, regression impact on 2 modules, and automation.”

#### 6. **Adjust for Reuse & Tools**

* Reusable automation = fewer points.
* Manual effort = more points.
* Complex test environments (e.g., mocking APIs or stubs) = higher points.

### 📝 Example

**User Story:** “As a user, I want to reset my password via email.”

#### QA Tasks:

* Review requirements (0.5)
* Write 6 test cases (1)
* Manual test UI (0.5)
* Backend email verification (1)
* Cross-browser test (0.5)
* Automation (optional) (2)
* Bug verification and retest (0.5)

**Total Estimated Story Points:** \~5–8 (based on team consensus and risk)

### 📌 Tips

* Keep a **reference matrix** of past stories and their points.
* Regularly **review estimation accuracy** in retrospectives.
* Don’t estimate purely on time — **think effort + complexity**.
