Analyzing **automation scope** is an essential part of test planning. It helps identify **what can and should be automated**, based on cost-benefit, stability, reusability, and ROI (Return on Investment). Here's a step-by-step method to analyze automation scope effectively:

---

## ✅ **How to Analyze Automation Scope**

### 🔍 1. **Understand the Application and Feature**

* What is the functionality under test?
* Is the feature **UI-based**, **API-based**, or **backend logic**?
* Is the feature **stable**, or will it change frequently?

> 🟡 If it's still under development or unstable, **defer automation**.

### ⚙️ 2. **Evaluate Test Case Suitability**

Use the **test case automation checklist**:

| Criteria                                              | Automation Suitability |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| **Repeatable**                                        | Yes ✅                  |
| **Frequently executed** (e.g., regression)            | Yes ✅                  |
| **Stable requirements**                               | Yes ✅                  |
| **High effort to test manually**                      | Yes ✅                  |
| **Data-driven scenarios**                             | Good candidate         |
| **Highly visual/subjective** (e.g., UI design checks) | ❌ No                   |
| **Short lifespan**                                    | ❌ No                   |
| **Requires heavy human judgment**                     | ❌ No                   |

### 📋 3. **Categorize Tests by Type**

| Test Type                       | Automation Priority    |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| **Smoke tests**                 | High ✅                 |
| **Regression tests**            | High ✅                 |
| **Sanity tests**                | Medium                 |
| **End-to-End flows**            | High (if stable)       |
| **Exploratory/UI layout tests** | Low ❌                  |
| **Negative test cases**         | Medium (if repeatable) |

---

### 🧮 4. **Analyze ROI (Return on Investment)**

Ask:

* How long will it take to automate?
* How often is the test executed?
* How much manual time does it save?
* Will it reduce release cycles?

> 🔁 Focus on **"Automate Once, Use Many Times"** cases.

---

### 🔧 5. **Check Tool and Framework Support**

* Can your automation framework (e.g., Selenium, RestAssured, Cucumber) support the technology used in the feature?
* Do you have reusable methods or page objects?
* Is test data generation feasible?

---

### 👥 6. **Coordinate with Developers & BAs**

* Confirm that functionality is **functionally complete**.
* Discuss any possible **backend/API hooks** to improve automation.
* Ask about **feature flags** or toggles.

---

### 🧭 7. **Prioritize Automation Scope**

Create a **priority matrix** like:

| Priority | Criteria                                  |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| High     | Smoke, regression, stable core features   |
| Medium   | Repeated scenarios with moderate coverage |
| Low      | UI-heavy, rarely run, unstable features   |

---

## 📊 Final Output: Automation Scope Report

For each user story or feature:

| Test Case / Feature         | Automation Feasible (Y/N) | Priority | Notes                           |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------- |
| Login functionality         | Yes ✅                     | High     | Stable, used in all test cycles |
| UI theme changes            | No ❌                      | Low      | Too visual                      |
| API POST request validation | Yes ✅                     | Medium   | Data-driven                     |
