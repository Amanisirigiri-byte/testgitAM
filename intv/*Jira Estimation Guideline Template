## üìã **Jira Estimation Guideline Template for QA/Testing**

### üìå Purpose:

To provide a consistent framework for QA team members to estimate testing effort using story points in Jira.

### ‚úÖ **1. Estimation Criteria**

| Criteria                           | Description                                          | Points to Consider                       |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Complexity**                     | Number of business rules, logic paths                | More complex workflows = higher points   |
| **Test Case Count**                | How many test cases need to be written and executed  | More cases = more effort                 |
| **Test Data**                      | Is test data already available or needs setup/mock?  | More data prep = more points             |
| **Environment Setup**              | Any special setup needed (mock services, stubs, DB)? | New setups = higher effort               |
| **Regression Scope**               | How many areas will be impacted?                     | Broader impact = more regression         |
| **Automation Involved**            | Is automation in-sprint or post-sprint?              | In-sprint automation = include in points |
| **Bug Verification Effort**        | Estimate expected bug rework and retesting           | High rework probability = higher points  |
| **Cross-platform / Cross-browser** | Testing across multiple browsers/devices             | More combinations = higher points        |

### üßÆ **2. Story Point Estimation Matrix**

| Story Points | Description                                                        | QA Examples                                            |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **1**        | Very basic test, minimal risk, few or no test cases                | Label update, UI alignment check                       |
| **2**        | Simple testing with few validations                                | Login field test, single API response                  |
| **3**        | Moderate test cases, simple flow with some validation              | Reset password, upload file feature                    |
| **5**        | Moderate complexity, backend integration, manual + some automation | Form validations, API validations, role-based access   |
| **8**        | Complex flow, multiple validations, E2E testing                    | Checkout flow, workflow with 3 user roles              |
| **13**       | High effort, multiple dependencies, large regression area          | Multi-module integration testing, mobile + web testing |
| **21**       | Too large ‚Äì split into smaller stories                             | Entire new module or feature                           |

### üìä **3. Jira Usage Tips**

* **Estimation Field**: Use the `Story Points` field in Jira.
* **Assignee**: Set QA or testing team member who owns the story.
* **Labels**: Use labels like `QA`, `Automation`, `Regression`, `TestData` for filtering.
* **Sub-tasks** (optional):
  Create sub-tasks like:

  * Write Test Cases
  * Execute Tests
  * Bug Re-testing
  * Automation (if in-sprint)

### üîÅ **4. Review & Adjust**

| Activity          | When                                                              |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Estimation Review | During Sprint Planning or Refinement                              |
| Point Adjustment  | If major scope or requirement changes                             |
| Retrospective     | Use story point vs actual effort to fine-tune estimates over time |
