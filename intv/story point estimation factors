## ‚úÖ **Story Point Estimation Matrix for Testing**

| Story Points                      | Description                                                                          | Example QA Tasks                                                                                                                |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1 (Very Low)**                  | Very simple change, low risk, minimal validation. No data setup needed.              | - UI label change<br>- Single field validation<br>- Test case update only                                                       |
| **2 (Low)**                       | Simple functionality, clear acceptance criteria, limited scenarios.                  | - Login field validation<br>- Basic form testing<br>- Simple API test                                                           |
| **3 (Medium-Low)**                | Slightly more complex logic, a few validations, some data setup.                     | - Password reset<br>- Validating user role access<br>- Testing pagination logic                                                 |
| **5 (Medium)**                    | Multiple validation points, moderate backend interaction, and edge cases.            | - New screen testing<br>- CRUD operations<br>- Integration with backend API<br>- Some automation included                       |
| **8 (High)**                      | Complex logic, multiple components, regression impact, possible automation.          | - Checkout flow<br>- Multi-step forms<br>- Workflow involving multiple roles and permissions                                    |
| **13 (Very High)**                | High complexity, unknowns, test data creation, multiple environments or systems.     | - Testing across platforms (web/mobile)<br>- End-to-end order placement with payment<br>- Test data stubbing, mocks needed      |
| **21+ (Epic or Needs Splitting)** | Too large for one sprint, needs breakdown. May include multiple stories or features. | - Entire module testing<br>- New feature with automation + performance testing<br>- Requires coordination across multiple teams |

### üîç Key Estimation Factors

| Factor                | Considerations                                   |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Complexity**        | Number of conditions, workflows, business logic  |
| **Data Setup**        | Need for stubs, test data creation, environments |
| **Integration**       | APIs, 3rd-party tools, DB interactions           |
| **Regression Impact** | Will it affect other modules?                    |
| **Automation Scope**  | Is automation needed? Is framework ready?        |
| **Uncertainty/Risks** | Are requirements unclear or changing?            |
