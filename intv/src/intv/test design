### âœ… How to Prepare a **Test Design** (Step-by-Step)

**Test design** is the process of creating test cases or test scenarios based on the requirements, user stories, or system design. A good test design ensures comprehensive coverage and detects defects early.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Step 1: Understand the Requirements

* Review the **Requirement Specification Document (BRD/SRS)** or **User Stories (Agile)**
* Identify:

  * Functional Requirements (e.g., Login should accept valid credentials)
  * Non-functional Requirements (e.g., load time < 2 sec)
  * Acceptance Criteria
  * Dependencies

---

### ðŸ”¹ Step 2: Identify Test Scenarios

From the requirements, break down high-level **test scenarios** (what to test).

**Example: Login Feature**

* Verify successful login with valid credentials
* Verify error with invalid password
* Verify login with blank fields
* Verify "Forgot Password" functionality

---

### ðŸ”¹ Step 3: Write Test Cases

Convert each scenario into detailed **test cases**, with inputs, steps, and expected results.

| Field               | Example                                                                       |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Test Case ID**    | TC\_Login\_001                                                                |
| **Module**          | Login                                                                         |
| **Test Scenario**   | Login with valid credentials                                                  |
| **Test Steps**      | 1. Go to login page<br>2. Enter valid username and password<br>3. Click login |
| **Test Data**       | Username: testuser<br>Password: Test\@123                                     |
| **Expected Result** | User should be navigated to dashboard                                         |
| **Actual Result**   | (To be filled after execution)                                                |
| **Status**          | Pass/Fail                                                                     |
| **Priority**        | High                                                                          |

### ðŸ”¹ Step 4: Apply Test Design Techniques (Optional but Recommended)

Use test design techniques to reduce redundancy and improve coverage:

| Technique                    | Use When                                                      |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Equivalence Partitioning** | Group inputs that should be treated the same                  |
| **Boundary Value Analysis**  | Input ranges (e.g., age = 18â€“60)                              |
| **Decision Table**           | Complex business rules                                        |
| **State Transition**         | Application changes state (e.g., Order -> Payment -> Shipped) |
| **Error Guessing**           | Based on testerâ€™s experience (e.g., try SQL in a field)       |

### ðŸ”¹ Step 5: Organize and Review

* Organize test cases in Excel, Test Management Tools (like TestRail, Zephyr, or JIRA Xray)
* Review with QA lead or peers
* Map test cases to requirements (for traceability)

---

### ðŸ”¹ Step 6: Prepare Test Data

* Define input values needed for execution
* Prepare positive and negative test data
* Ensure sensitive data is anonymized (if required)

---

### ðŸ”¹ Step 7: Review and Finalize

* Peer review test design
* Link test cases to requirements (RTM â€“ Requirement Traceability Matrix)
* Finalize and get sign-off

---

### ðŸ§  Example Test Design Summary (for Login):

| Test Scenario   | Positive Cases                   | Negative Cases                                |
| --------------- | -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Login           | Valid username & password        | Invalid password, blank fields, SQL injection |
| Forgot Password | Valid email                      | Invalid email, blank field                    |
| Session Timeout | Session expires after inactivity | Session still active after timeout            |

Would you like a **template in Excel or Word** for test design? Or do you want to **create test cases for a specific feature** (e.g., Search, Profile Update, etc.)?
